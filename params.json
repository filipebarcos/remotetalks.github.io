{"name":"Remotetalks.GitHub.io","tagline":"","body":"# Remote Talks\r\n\r\nThe idea of this community is to solve some problems related to meetups, basically we would like to:\r\n\r\n1. Go to a kind of \"remote meetup\"\r\n2. Create a remote \"friend-to-friend\" community of Developers.\r\n3. Create a good content with talks\r\n\r\n## Format of our remote meetup:\r\n\r\nIntroduction of participants (5min)\r\nShort introduction - Speaker (3min)\r\nTalk (20min) - Speaker - recorded by youtube \r\nQuestions and comments (15min)\r\n\r\nThe overall duration is about 40min, but the talk should be only 20min. The duration might be 20 minutes, because we would like to watch/listen the talk during a coffee break time. :- )\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
